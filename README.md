* Go to http://localhost:3030, click on add data, select files, mapping.ttl,
   upload all.
* The server status button (right top of the screen) should then be green. 
* In another terminal,
   Start the second server with the start script in the server2 directory.
* Go to http://localhost:3031, click on add data, select files, outputFood.ttl,
   upload all.
* The server status button (right top of the screen) should then be green. 

Testing the application
=======================
When the servers are started up, the application can be tested by opening page.html.
It is possible that securities of the browsers needs to be disabled do to cross-site scripting attacks detection. 
If application is published on a "real remote server" this problem is not present anymore.
